    <ul>13<sup>th</sup> of August, 2019: reorganized the website so that entries after the 9<sup>th</sup> of July 2019 are all located in their own page, distinguished from the main body of work. The release of such entries will still be detailed in the Changelog (edit as of 5/14/2020: see the change on 14<sup>th</sup> of May 2020 for more accurate information).</ul>
    <ul>14<sup>th</sup> of August, 2019: released a batch of <a href="2019/august2019.html#6A">three entries</a> starting on the 6<sup>th</sup> of August</a>, talking about Perfectly Generic Podcast survey and temporary channel merger of mspa-lit with general.</ul>
    <ul>26<sup>th</sup> of August, 2019: released <a href="2019/august2019.html#26A">one entry</a> detailing events of the second half of August, including announcement for Pesterquest and certain developments concerning Hussie.</ul>

    <ul>25<sup>th</sup> of October, 2019: released <a href="2019/october2019.html#25O">one entry</a> describing the announcement and release of Homestuck 2.</ul>
    <ul>26<sup>th</sup> of October, 2019: released <a href="2019/october2019.html#26O">one entry</a> detailing the Chapel Hill Pgenpodcast live showing.</ul>
    <ul>3<sup>rd</sup> of November, 2019: released <a href="2019/october2019.html#28O">four entries</a> detailing, in order: Homestuck Wiki edit wars, and Makin's wish failing and subsequent backup; Hiveswap Act 2 announcement trailer; Shill Seekers website by Gitaxian and Wadapan released; administrative changes to server, including new mods and rules added to welcome channel.</ul>
    <ul>11<sup>th</sup> of December, 2019: released <a href="2019/november2019.html#18N">five small entries</a> covering a variety of topics.</ul>
    <ul>31<sup>st</sup> of December, 2019: released <a href="2019/december2019.html#14D">three entries</a> from the latter half of December.</ul><br>
    <ul>3<sup>rd</sup> of January, 2020: <a href="2020.html#2J">first entry of the new year</a>, discussing Twitter callout posts and other drama.</ul>
    <ul>8<sup>th</sup> of January, 2020: <a href="2020.html#J8">two entries</a>, one about a new bot and another concerning internal conflict.</ul>
    <ul>15<sup>th</sup> of January, 2010: added a guestbook to the front page of SPAT so people can leave messages for everyone else to see. The software seems to be rather janky so far, but I'm hoping it's only temporary weirdness. I replaced the <a href="backcover.png">backcover</a> with the guestbook because it was taking up space and kind of broke the aesthetics of the page, so it can be located at the bottom of the front cover (edit: this is no longer the case due to the guestbook not working at all. The back cover and the guestbook have both been omitted from the frontpage of SPAT).</ul>
    <ul>19<sup>th</sup> of January, 2020: added <a href="2020.html#19J">one entry</a> detailing escalation of the callout drama from Twitter, including involvement with Kate and Griever. Also described a few random things in the server that were nice.</ul>
    <ul>11<sup>th</sup> of February, 2020: added <a href="2020.html#F11">one entry</a> concerning escalations of fandom drama, and Makin stepping down from control of subreddit and HSD.</ul>
    <ul>8<sup>th</sup> of April, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#fool">two entries,</a> first about April Fool's Day event and then a brief description of general server proceedings.</ul>
    <ul>24<sup>th</sup> of April, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#A13">two entries</a>, one about 4/13/2020 and one about a couple smaller things within the community.</ul>
    <ul>30<sup>th</sup> of April, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#A29">one entry</a> detailing controversy around a Homestuck 2 update from the day before, as well as a couple other minor notes.</ul>
    <ul>14<sup>th</sup> of May, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#12M">two entries</a> talking about various users of the HSD. Also reorganized SPAT to reframe the timeline. Originally, SPAT was considered "formally ended" on its second anniversary, the 9<sup>th</sup> of July 2019 due to lessening motivation to write. However, further reflection after Makin stepping down in February of 2020 and a resurgence of interest in writing SPAT led me to believe it would be more prudent to restructure the website, so that the beginning of the journal up to me becoming the owner could be "Book I," and "Book II" could begin after that. This is less awkward structuring and also eliminates the weirdness of continuing to write so much after SPAT was "ended."</ul>
    <ul>14<sup>th</sup> of May, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#25M">five entries</a> covering late May and the beginning of June.</ul>
    <ul>16<sup>th</sup> of July, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#23J">four entries</a> covering random stuff, the last of which is an explanation of the drama centering around negotiations with Hussie back in February. Refer to the entry for a link to the Related Materials with a full transcript of the proceedings in question.</ul>
    <ul>20<sup>th</sup> of August, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#19A">one entry</a> describing activity of various users new and old, and <a href="relatedmaterials/appendB.html#iceberg">one addition</a> to Related Materials Appendix B written by Teratosapphic describing various memes in server's culture.</ul>
    <ul>30<sup>th</sup> of September, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#10S" target="_blank">five entries</a> discussing a variety of topics. Also added a new page to the General Contents called <a href="currentstatistics.html" target="_blank">Current Statistics</a>, containing information which was originally included in the Introduction as well as some new info. Keeping it here will serve both to keep the introduction less confusing in terms of informing the reader, and also make it easier to update the information within.</ul>
    <ul>13<sup>th</sup> of October, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#11O" target="_blank">one entry</a> detailing Makin coming back as server owner, as well as other details he provided which are immediately relevant, including reopening the Patreon, future direction of server, and a fourth Reckoning. Appropriately, updated the Current Statistics to reflect changes in staff.</ul>
    <ul>23<sup>rd</sup> of December, 2020: added <a href="bookii2020.html#23O" target="_blank">several entries</a> covering a litany of events, including 10/25/2020, the release of Hiveswap: Act 2, and the announcement of Andrew Hussie's new project.</ul>
    <ul>4<sup>th</sup> of January, 2021: added <a href="bookii2020.html#24D" target="_blank">three entries</a> transitioning from the old year to the new, including a smaller, less serious version of the user contributions for the end of 2020.

    <ul>19<sup>th</sup> of February, 2021: added <a href="bookii2021.html#19F" target="_blank">one entry</a> after a significant dry spell in writing, which describes the main developments in official property and provides an update on a few things that have been taking place in the HSD.</ul>
    <ul>5<sup>th</sup> of March, 2021: added <a href="bookii2021.html#23F" target="_blank">three entries</a>, including one for the fifth anniversary of the HSD describing a small, informal census of mspa-lit.</ul>
    <ul>15<sup>th</sup> of April, 2021: added <a href="bookii2021.html#13A" target="_blank">one entry</a> detailing 4/13 for the year and a couple other minor details.</ul>
    <ul>1<sup>st</sup> of August, 2021: added <a href="bookii2021.html#1Au" target="_blank">one entry</a> covering all noteworthy events since the last update.</ul>
