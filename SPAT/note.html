    <p>The Homestuck Discord is still going, and I still write stuff, don't worry. <a href="laterentries.html" target="_blank">Book II</a> will have information whenever it feels prudent for me to write about it, which will almost certainly be more sporadic in nature due to not wanting to cover the same topics or describe the same events repeatedly.</p>
    <p>If you're curious about when certain changes have been made to this website, the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> should be helpful. <strong>This will also include when the latest release came out, and what it covers.</strong></p><hr>
