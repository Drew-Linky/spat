<p><strong>Book I</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Indisputably the main body of this document. Book I contains by far the most dense writing, with entries on a near daily basis for two years, and then less frequently from August 2019 up through February of 2020. This also contains most of the establishing information on history of the Homestuck Discord, Subreddit, and pieces of other parts of the fandom. Of course, it also contains descriptions of most of the people involved in discussions within the HSD (though this may change as time goes on, due to shifts in the population). Entries are organized on a monthly basis from 2017 to the end of 2019, then January and February 2020 are together on the last page.</p>

<p><strong>Book II</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>This second part of SPAT starts in April of 2020, two months after Makin stepped down and put me in control of the community. To cut down on time and effort spent organizing, these will be lumped purely by year and have no individual monthly pages (this may change if my writing picks up considerably, but don't count on it). This is debatably "the sequel" to SPAT, although it is written pretty much the same way; the main difference is that there's much less writing at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous Information</strong></p>
<p><a href="submissions/contributions.html">User Contributions</a></p>
<blockquote><p>When I originally "ended" the main body of content in July 2019, I asked for various members of the Homestuck Discord, historied and contemporary, to provide their thoughts. This may seem dramatic or out of place considering I bothered to continue writing entries anyway, but I feel as if these contributions--totaling around 50 individual pieces--are a significant representation of the people I care so deeply about, as well as their mindset. As far as preserving our culture is concerned, this is undoubtedly one of the most important pieces of writing on this website.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="relatedmaterials/table.html">Related Materials</a></p>
<p><blockquote>A collection of information from interviews, data archives, and a plethora of other sources that can be accessed to obtain greater understanding of the HSD and its history, as well as that of the greater fandom. While typically stable in structure, certain developments may occur such that the document is radically altered to encompass all of the information more efficiently. Thus, there may be a difference between the descriptions in this document and the headings/subheadings within the Related Materials. If anything seems inaccurate or different, don't hesitate to reach out to me.</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="currentstatistics.html">Current Statistics</a></p>
<p><blockquote>A brief assortment of information detailing who is in charge of what in the HSD, as well as how many people there are on the server and an estimated level of activity in terms of active users and message counts per day, in total and by channel. Stats are not updated in real time, instead the last date information is published will be listed at the top.</blockquote></p><hr>
