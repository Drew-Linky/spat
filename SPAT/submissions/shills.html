<p>The previous contribution might have made me sound like I'm obsessed and insane, but do not panic, because I'm about to be obsessed and insane about a different thing.</p>
<br>
<p>Let's talk <b>SHILLS</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>Though often mentioned in SPAT, I doubt many people have done anything more than give <a href="https://recordcrash.com/shills.html">it</a> (or homestuck.net/shills, or whatever URL the list has at the moment, gotta future proof this) a cursory look. I feel that people are missing extremely important and highly good fiction, so I'm going to go through every single shill in the list and explain in my own words why it's worth reading with minimal spoilers. I might add this to the page itself eventually, I dunno.</p>
<br>
<h3>…And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes, by Scott Alexander</h3>
<p>This is a perfect introduction to the list. It's really hard to talk about this without spoiling it, because it can be read in about twenty minutes. But I'll try.</p>
<p>The story is based on a common internet meme with a list of pills, each of which give unique powers. You're meant to choose one, and the pill you selected is kinda meant to cause an internet argument with whoever chose differently. "Well, <i>I</i> think immortality is better than mind powers", stuff like that. But Scott takes it in a different direction: what if he wrote a story where all the pills were taken by different people in a shared world? What would the consequences be if they were to exploit the silly powers to their natural conclusion?</p>
<p>This story really embodies the "rational fiction" ideals in a small package, making it the natural choice as the best shill to read.</p>
<br>
<h3>Worth the Candle, by Alexander Wales</h3>
<p>A writer with a strong talent for interesting worldbuilding and magic systems decides to put all of them in a single story, and drop a 17 year old fictional copy of his 17 year old self into it. You'd expect this to quickly devolve into a power fantasy self insert, but it never quite happens. The protagonist has to deal with all the psychological baggage from his real life, also dropped into the game in fictionalized, gamified ways. Everything is examined, the narrative is analyzed, and no stones are left unturned. All done in really intelligent, subversive and entertaining ways. You'll never wonder "Why didn't he do that instead?".</p>
<p>This is the next Homestuck. Think about it. A game world based on the player's life and personality, and a story filled with random concepts that the author had consumed and worked on for years, over a million words long? I personally believe this is <i>better</i>. If you're willing to put in the time investment, I recommend starting with this one right after Pills.</p>
<br>
<h3>Worm, by Wildbow</h3>
<p>Do you like the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Now imagine if the world actually made sense, if the powers were used cleverly, and if the plots were actually good. A superhero story for people who have suffered too much of the average superhero writing. Enough has been said about Worm, I think, that I feel comfortable leaving this one as it is.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Northern Caves, by Nostalgebraist</h3>
<p>What would happen if Andrew Hussie had died right before releasing the insane end of Homestuck, and the hardcore fans unearthed it a long time after the death of the mainstream fandom?</p>
<p>A story loosely based on the history of the MSPA forums, it's particularly worth reading due to its format and use of the medium: you'll get a ton of forum posts that read true to life. Horrible signatures, horrible nicknames, and a culture you wish you could know more about. Unwittingly predicted some of the reaction to the Homestuck Epilogues. An excellent mystery story with some supernatural dips, just don't expect an ending that ties everything up.</p>
<br>
<h3>17776, by Jon Bois</h3>
<p>Honestly, if you're a Homestuck fan you've most likely already read this one. What if Andrew Hussie wrote a hilarious story about what football would be like in a future with virtual immortality and no limits, examined from the perspective of a naive newcomer? Not just for football fans, and featuring the most accidentally Dave-like character of all time.</p>
<br>
<h3>Crystal Society, by Max Harms</h3>
<p>The first "real" novel of the list, but available for free. A mildly sociopathic group of Artificial Intelligences has to work together to control a robot body and escape their current circumstances. What is an AI society like when every individual component was designed to achieve a different goal? Pretty amazingly well written sci-fi.</p>
<br>
<h3>Modern Cannibals, by Bavitz</h3>
<p>Another story based on the Homestuck fandom. Written by Bavitz, a mysterious writer with a penchant for literary writing of the highest quality, so expect Themes, weird prose and unique character voices.</p>
<p>The main character's friend has been taken over by Homestuck mania, and she chases him to a fan convention where Andrew Hussie is going to be at. Weird shit happens as you'd expect from the Homestuck fandom, including insane canadians, anime, drugs and rap battles. More of a serious story than you'd expect from the previous description, and the perfect read for someone wanting to get a feel of 2012's Homestuck fandom.</p>
<br>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, by EY</h3>
<p>Go to the Worm description, read that and apply its message to Harry Potter. Featuring a highly controversial main character who is actually meant to initially be a little shit and mature by the end of the book. It's not required to know Harry Potter from anything other than cultural osmosis to understand HPMOR, though you might miss some jokes. Some scientific and "rationality" concepts are thrown around, so it doubles as a somewhat didactic work.</p>
<br>
<h3>Unsong, by Scott Alexander</h3>
<p>Imagine if everything in the Bible was to be taken literally. Yes, even that part. The protagonist wields his expertise in religious wordplay in a new world where scripture is a real magic, and societies struggle worldwide to adapt to the new state of events. A completely silly and hilarious story that Terry Pratchett might have once written.</p>
<br>
<h3>CORDYCEPS, by Benedict_SC</h3>
<p>Do you like SCP, or horror stories about memetic threats? This is actually a good, short, regrettably obscure take on that. The one story in this list where being rational is actually harmful to the user.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Man From Earth</h3>
<p>Okay, the very premise of this movie is a spoiler. It's available for free on Torrent sites, uploaded by the director himself, since he cared to get his life's work's story out there more than he cared about profit. Do you like normal people talking in a room about interesting stuff for 90 minutes? This is your film, but there might be some twists oOoOoO.</p>
<br>
<h3>Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe, by Crippledvulture</h3>
<p>You... like Homestuck and Problem Sleuth, right? Now imagine if the adventure game mechanics were actually good. Another work where the premise is kind of a spoiler, so just expect a surprisingly poignant story based on tackling problems with Imagination powers. The best adventure ever made by someone other than Andrew Hussie.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mother of Learning, by nobody103</h3>
<p>An incredibly comfy story about an untalented mage taking advantage of a time loop... to study harder. There's also a city-wide invasion coming he probably needs to stop, and threats that you wouldn't expect from this spoiler free description.</p>
<p>This has taken a dive quality wise in the last two books, so it might not be in the list by the time you read this. The first couple books are definitely worth reading, however. Think all the whimsy and fun of Harry Potter magic combined with the mystery and growth of more complex fantasy stories and some original exploity twists to the genre.</p>
<br>
<h3>Kid Radd, by Dan Miller</h3>
<p>This was the story Wreck-it Ralph ripped off (and then its sequel, even harder). A video game character achieves sentience right in time for its game to be discontinued. He joins a team of characters from different video games to save others, and eventually fight an entity threatening the future of retro. The one good sprite comic in the entire internet. Video game mechanics from different games used together in clever, unique ways. An unique story that Ralph entirely failed to live up to.</p>
<br>
<h3>Dream Drive, by Andrew Ball</h3>
<p>Much like WTC, this initially by-the-numbers literary RPG eventually uncovers some twists that turn it into a sci-fi masterpiece. Expect a lot of character growth, with the main character constantly being called out on his bullshit and the "villains" often having justifications for being like they are. Many interesting twists to the dropped-into-a-game genre, but unfortunately the best ones are too spoilery to be included here. Just trust me.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it IS hosted on literotica and has like five sex scenes. It's a 375k word story and the scenes only take up like 5k. Just skip past everything but the beginning and end of them, they're usually not entirely pointless.</p>
<br>
<h3>Three Worlds Collide, by EY</h3>
<p>A complex moral and philosophical quandary between a human ship and baby-eating aliens. Featuring the stupidest comparison between Hamlet and Fate/Stay Night ever put to virtual paper. Any takes I'd have on this story are already in the (very short) story itself, so you'll just have to read it!</p>
<br>
<h3>Transdimensional Brain Chip, by Øyvind Thorsby</h3>
<p>The art of this story is complete trash. Give this a pass if you're a baby that can't deal with that. Do you enjoy reading hilarious visual comedy about sci-fi plots that quickly devolve into insanity? Then don't give this a pass.</p>
<p>A chip is installed into idiot Ulf's brain, and it allows him to coordinate with alternate-universe, choice-splitting versions of himself. Those versions quickly diverge and they uncover a secret threatening every dimension. These idiots are the only chance to save it, through the power of throwing enough alternate selves at the problem.</p>
<br>
<h3>Ever 17, by Kotaro Uchikoshi</h3>
<p>The best shill on the list. It is also the most annoying shill to read, since you have to deal with 2005 visual novel graphics and "gameplay", but it is also the most worth reading. People who recognize the name Zero Escape or even Danganronpa somewhat know what to expect from this, but for everyone else, just be sure that this story uses its medium perfectly to deliver the best series of twists in fiction and outdoes them all. Do follow the guide with the order Tsugumi->Sara->Sora->You, please, instead of the one the guide suggests.</p>
<p>I can smell Drew seething at Ever 17 being called the best shill on the list from here. It is, deal with it.</p>
<br>
<h3>John Dies at the End, by David Wong</h3>
<p>This story is just fucking funny. While it does have the philosophical themes and munchkin-like exploits that this list is known for, this story mainly excels at making people laugh, which is an achievement in an otherwise horror story. Also the main characters are named John and Dave, which can't be a coincidence (or can it???). Actually published, a best-seller even, but sadly gone missing from the cultural zeitgeist lately. The movie is fun once you've read the book but otherwise trash and not worth watching.</p>
<br>
<h3>The Library Unpublished, by al_fa</h3>
<p>Don't read this before The Northern Caves. A similar type of story, where the internet and the power of choices feature prominently. Very meta, very mysterious. Don't want to say more about it</p>
<br>
<h3>LOST, by Damon Lindelof</h3>
<p>Wait this is actually in the extended shills list. Just watch it, okay? I hear Drew is going to stream it sometime this millenium.</p>
<br>
<h3>Several People are Ty-pfft</h3>
<p>If you made it here you either are a coward who skips to the end or a brave literary warrior still looking for good stories. Stop reading this then, you moron, and go read the stories above and in the extended list. Who knows if the original has had more stuff added since this was posted?</p>
