<p>Man, where do I begin. I’ve been on the HSD for 3 years and maybe a couple of months now, and to say you’ve been at the same place for 3 years, yet you never lose focus or excitement of that place is a well overcame hardship. 
</p>
<p>I joined the HSD when I first installed discord, and to say I was a problem user was an understatement, I was the worst of the worst, an ALTGEN REGULAR. But after that “arc” of my life is now long over I became a general regular, meeting some of my best friends I’m still friends with today, Nikki, Neth, Angel, Red,Toast and Dingus to name a few. </p>

<p>Around the same time of becoming a general regular I started to speak more friendly with everyone in the channel, and become a part of it. Around this time I was asked to be a gen pseudo, and I happily accepted because I wanted to look over general and watch it grow as the server did. Maybe 3 months after that I was upgraded to a full moderator, and I still retain the spot after 2 reckonings, which I am so happy to have kept. 
</p>
<p>Spending my time on the HSD has increased my overall mood in real life and other places, and I’ve met some of my longest lasting friends because of the HSD, I wouldn’t be able to name all of them, but I can give some descriptions of the ones who’ve impacted me the most.</p>

<p><strong>Sandy</strong>, dude. I know when I first joined the server I was a literal child and more than a handful to handle, but as I grew I became less and less pepega. You’ve given me some of the hardest laughs I’ve had on the server and I’m sure many other people can say that. I enjoy the time we play vidya and just chill out to talk. Looking forward to what comes next. </p>

<p><strong>Valkyrie</strong>, even though I’ve known you the shortest amount of time out of everyone, you have still made an impact in my life just as large as everyone else. The memories I’ve made with you have made me happier as a whole and I’m very glad because of it. Hopefully we continue to be very good friends, egirl.</p>

<p><strong>Erie</strong>, I’ve known you since the day I joined and let me say it’s certainly been a ride with you. You’re without a doubt one of the most prominent gen members and you’re always there while I’m there, I remember the nights where it would be 4 am and it was only you and I in gen just talking about shit, and stuff like that really made me appreciate you. </p>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>Drew</strong>. Drew was there for me since the moment I got modded, telling me what to do at what times and giving directions in a way anyone could understand. Drew to me has been like a mentor on how to treat other people, and how to handle situations that you normally wouldn’t see every day. Then there's the times when we gather up everyone and play some group vidya together, memories like that will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>As a conclusion statement, this server means so much to me, and I wish to be apart of it for a very long time, I’m glad to say that the HSD has made an impact in my life, thanks.</p>
