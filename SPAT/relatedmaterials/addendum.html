<p>Hi. I’m WoC. I offered to write an addendum because I saw the journal and thought it was an interesting idea. His information is now slightly out of date, however -- I no longer live in that 1,000 population town (not even a town, really, more of a community), as I now live at Longwood University, where I’m a physics major. I try not to electrocute myself too much here.</p><p>	He’s broadly right in terms of describing me; the only real major detail he fucked up was that it was a groundhog, not a prairie dog. I’ve done a lot of really stupid shit, frankly, and I’m sorta lucky to be alive. I’m not really trying to be abrasive, I just don’t have much of a filter. He’s right when he describes me as a redneck. I have a hard time telling what’s politically correct and when, because I grew up in an environment where that simply didn’t happen. I enjoy firearms, physics, engineering, video games, cooking, and alcohol. Drew has told me repeatedly I have a drinking problem, but I disagree -- I can drink just fine.</p><p>	Right now I’m the #gaming enforcer; I re-joined the server for awhile because #gaming had gone to hell and I wanted to fix that. I like the channel. I like video games. I’ve played so fucking many video games that I’m qualified to have an opinion on most of them, which is why I enjoy interacting with the users there; no matter what, I’ll probably have some sort of opinion or advice. The only question is whether I’m gonna have time in between all my classes.</p><p>	Drew has a tendency to hang out in the #mspa-lit channel (currently called something absolutely retarded, as usual), which means he focuses on it, so I’m going to try to avoid talking about that particular shitpile of drama for too long. Instead, I wanted to mention the addition of the channel #social and also a quick history of the #serious channel.</p><p>	One quick thing, however: the thing you want to remember about #mspa-lit is that, as Drew mentioned, it’s pretty goddamn cliquey, and I myself want to see the whole thing just gone. I recognize that nobody agrees with me in the matter here, but there we are. I think it’s just a channel for Makin to talk about pretty much anything he wants, and that its purpose is easily served by other channels. #social was literally created so that Makin could tell people to stop talking about their personal lives in #mspa-lit so he could get back to whatever he wanted to talk about. You’ll see frequent calls to move to #gaming, or to #social, or to #serious, or to #anime, depending on whatever is currently interrupting Makin’s train of thought.</p><p>	Anyway, my point here is that a new channel got made specifically for that-- people to talk about their personal lives. It’s like #general, but for a slightly more… not exactly positive crowd, more like hugbox-ey crowd. It’s currently a channel for people to give vague compliments and utter phrases like “oh no, you’re beautiful, it’s fine”. I do my best to disrupt the flow of navel-gazing with bursts of sheer hostility just for a bit of difference. It’s a thankless job, and nobody needs to do it, and in fact I probably shouldn’t do it, but dammit, I have serious issues with just letting people sit in a corner and tell each other that it’s okay to never, ever change. Alongside the meaningless complimentary attitude, the channel has frequent bouts of obsession over weird shit. As I’m typing this, the channel is currently talking about how they want to marry everyone and they’re making fake plans and it’s just insane. The point of all this is, despite the fact that the channel’s kind of redundant, it’s developed a small community of its own. It was interesting to watch it happen from literally nothing.</p><p>	The other thing I wanted to mention is that #serious was a festering shithole for many, many months. Initially, the channel was started as a “absolutely NO shitposting” channel, for topics of serious discussion like political affairs and whatnot. Economics, brexit, pretty much any discussion that could be taken seriously. However, eventually it became a channel for people to talk about personal problems-- emotional issues, girl troubles, boy troubles, what have you. This was also fine, since it tended to share space with the political talk and overall the channel was pretty good.</p><p>	However, after that, the channel attracted a crowd of people who wanted to talk about way darker personal issues-- suicidal thoughts, self-harm, depression, et cetera. The serious discussions got wiped out and the channel became a place for people to talk about their deepest, darkest feelings. This was an interesting direction to go in, but it also brought in a whole horde of attention seekers. These people would come in, every single day, and talk about the same issue, over and over, while refusing to actually do anything about it. They were very clearly in it for the attention of others. I’d stopped using the channel by this point, it was a little much for me. The channel had gone from solid to used for whining. It was a pretty sad transition to watch, frankly. Sometimes you would get the odd person who actually needed help, but by this point there were so many people dedicated to “helping” (offering useless, useless advice and trying to calm people down) that nothing would really happen.</p><p>	Since then, though, the channel has seemingly cleared up. Right now it’s being used to talk about issues within the server itself, which is fine, and actual serious discussion has made a return. The attention seekers have mostly fucked off (when you have a community based around suicidal impulses, don’t expect it to last long). The activity level as a whole is much lower, but in my opinion that’s a good thing. Wild, crazy channels tend to require much more policing. I’ll be interested to see what the community as a whole defines as worthy of “serious” discussion in the future.</p>
