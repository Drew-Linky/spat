        <p>This journal has been and I’m sure will continue to be an interesting experience for me to write, and there is absolutely no way I would be able to do it at this point without the feedback and assistance I’ve received from the numerous people I’ve talked to, and especially those who read it and offer their insight. To everyone who has bothered to look at the journal<sup><span title="ALSO THANKS TO ME WHO REVIEWED THE WHOLE THING TWICE">1</span></sup> or give me their opinions on it: thank you. And as Makin said, an extra big thanks to him for reading through this entire document a second time and giving his more in depth feedback while preparing this document for public release.</p>
        <p>To everyone on the Homestuck Discord that I talk to so frequently, you make me feel like I can get through the day. Even when my responsibilities in real life are crushing, it is a breath of fresh air to be able to come online and talk to you guys. There’s no way I could provide an exhaustive list of everyone I talk to on the HSD, but rest assured you’re in my thoughts. I appreciate you guys, sincerely.</p>
        <p>Large thanks are due to literally anyone who has offered me information that could go in here. This is especially true of everyone that can be found in the appendixes:</p>
        <p>wheals for being especially helpful and pointing me in the right direction to find additional information about various historical elements of the fandom, as well as providing a history of CANMT</p>
        <p>cait for agreeing to write an incredibly large journal of her own detailing LOFAM's history</p>
        <p>phantos and many others for being supportive and talking with me when i was feeling overwhelmed with my responsibilities here</p>
        <p>3tych and Schazer for providing information about the MSPA forums and their history</p>
        <p>nixshadow for providing information about MSPFA's creation and history</p>
        <p>Members of the Music Team for their comprehensive responses to my questions, including Thomas Ferkol, Erik “Jit” Scheele, Kali, Alexander “AlbatrossSoup” Rosetti, Michael Bowman, RJ Lake, and Tensei.</p>
        <p>O for being enigmatic as usual and yet still informative with his responses to my questions about his work on CANWC.</p>
        <p>Thanks again to Makin for making the front and back covers of this journal.</p>
        <p>An ENORMOUS thanks to tmtmtl30 for helping me to convert this document into a proper website, to Rina (rainbowCultist) for helping me set up a Github repo, and one of my absolute best friends Alexa for helping me learn the HTML and CSS to get this website up (as well as handling a significant portion of the backend).</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest thanks goes to everyone who wrote material for the user contributions.</p><hr>
