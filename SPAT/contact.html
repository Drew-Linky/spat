    <h2><center>Support</center></h2>
    <p>For any of you reading this, I hope that this document has been entertaining, informative, or even both. I have with great consideration opened up a profile on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/" target="_blank">Ko-Fi</a>, as it seems the most appropriate choice of crowdfunding available for a project like this. I maintain this document completely for my own satisfaction and to keep the memory of this community alive as the years go by, but if you so desire to support me then the link for my page can be found <a href="http://ko-fi.com/drewlinky" target="_blank">here</a><sup><span id="footnote" title="Drew finally sells out. Sad!">1</span></sup>. <em>Do not feel obligated to contribute if you do not wish to do so;</em> I would be immensely appreciative, but this resource is first and foremost meant to be enjoyed openly and without any sort of charge.</p><hr>
